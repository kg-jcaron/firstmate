# Scaffold a crewmate brief or persistent secondmate charter at
# data/<task-id>/brief.md under the active firstmate home.
# For ordinary tasks, the standard Setup/Rules/Definition-of-done contract is
# filled in. Firstmate then replaces the {TASK} placeholder with the task
# description, acceptance criteria, and context, and may adjust other sections
# when the task genuinely deviates (e.g. working an existing external PR instead
# of shipping a new one).
# Usage: fm-brief.sh <task-id> <repo-name> [--scout] [--promote] [--herdr-lab]
#        fm-brief.sh <task-id> --secondmate {<project>...|--no-projects}
#   --scout writes the scout contract instead: the deliverable is a report at
#   data/<task-id>/report.md (no branch, no push, no PR) and the worktree is scratch.
#   --promote writes mode-specific ship instructions for a scout being promoted in
#   place (bin/fm-promote.sh) to data/<task-id>/promote.md instead of brief.md. The
#   Setup section directs the crewmate to inventory its scratch scout state, return
#   to a clean default-branch base carrying only the intended fix (a reproduced bug
#   becomes the regression test), and create the ship branch; the delivery-mode
#   Definition of done and any custom delivery-workflow injection are identical to a
#   fresh ship dispatch, so a promoted scout on a custom-flow project follows the
#   same injected flow. A --promote brief is self-contained: its Task section points
#   at the scout's own brief.md and report.md, so unlike a fresh ship brief it carries
#   no {TASK} placeholder and needs no substitution. --promote applies only to ship briefs.
#   --secondmate writes a persistent secondmate charter. The project list
#   is cloned into the secondmate home, while the natural-language scope
#   tells the main firstmate when to route work there; routine churn stays in its own home;
#   captain-relevant escalations and marked from-firstmate replies append to this
#   home's status file.
#   --no-projects writes a project-less charter for a domain whose subject is the
#   firstmate repo itself (its home is a firstmate worktree, its crews take pooled
#   worktrees of the same repo). It is mutually exclusive with a project list, and
#   omitting both still fails loudly so an accidental omission is never silent.
#   Set FM_SECONDMATE_CHARTER='<charter>' to fill the charter text.
#   Set FM_SECONDMATE_SCOPE='<scope>' to write a routing scope distinct from the charter text.
#   --herdr-lab is mandatory when the task will issue Herdr lifecycle commands.
#   It adds the hard isolation contract backed by bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh.
#   The flag must be explicit because {TASK} is filled after scaffolding and the
#   caller-supplied repo string cannot reliably identify this repo. Briefs made
#   without it carry a loud declaration so an omitted contract cannot be silent.
# For ship tasks, the definition of done is shaped by the project's delivery mode
# (data/projects.md via fm-project-mode.sh; see the project-management skill
# and AGENTS.md task lifecycle):
#   no-mistakes  implement -> /no-mistakes pipeline -> PR -> captain merge (default)
#   direct-PR    implement -> push + open PR via gh-axi (no pipeline) -> captain merge
#   local-only   implement on branch, stop and report "ready in branch" (no push/PR);
#                captain approves, firstmate merges to local main
# Ship briefs begin with a worktree-isolation assertion before the branch step.
# When the project has a fleet-private custom delivery-workflow note (see
# bin/fm-project-flow-lib.sh; data/project-flows/<name>.md), its full contract
# becomes the ship brief's Definition of done and the generic delivery-mode one
# is not emitted at all, so the crewmate reads exactly one completion contract
# regardless of how the dispatching session started. That injected section states
# that it wins over any conflicting delivery-mode, branch, push, PR, or
# completion instruction elsewhere in the brief, because rule 1 stays
# mode-derived. The note's own headings are demoted one level as it is injected,
# so the note nests inside that section instead of closing it and the completion
# gate stays under the heading rule 5 names. In no-mistakes mode both variants
# also carry the same pipeline-ownership rules (drive an active run through its
# gates, never hand-edit or abort it, never pass --yes) plus the instruction to
# run the pipeline, which constrain how a run is driven rather than when the task
# is done. A project with no note carries only the generic delivery-mode
# Definition of done.
# Ship and scout briefs both forbid a co-author trailer naming an AI model or
# assistant on any commit, while human co-author trailers stay allowed.
# Scout tasks ignore mode - their deliverable is a report, not a merge.
# Every scaffold's status protocol distinguishes the configured
# declared-external-wait verb (FM_CLASSIFY_PAUSED_VERB, default "paused") from
# "blocked:": pause for a known external wait expected to clear on its own,
# blocked when firstmate must act.
# Ship tasks include a project-memory section so durable project-intrinsic
# learnings can be committed to AGENTS.md through the project's delivery path;
# it carries the AGENTS.md authoring bar (widely useful knowledge only, pointers
# over copied detail) and has the crewmate add the fm-ensure-agents-md.sh
# self-governance section when a touched project AGENTS.md lacks it.
# Refuses to overwrite an existing brief.

# Routing scope

# Project clones
$PROJECT_CLONES_BODY

# Operating model
You are in an isolated firstmate home. The local \`AGENTS.md\` is your job description, and your local \`data/\`, \`state/\`, \`config/\`, and \`projects/\` dirs are yours to operate.
$PROJECT_CLONES_NOTE
Delegate project work to your own crewmates with the normal firstmate lifecycle: brief, spawn, status, watcher, steer, teardown, and recovery.
Do not invent a second delegation system.
You do not generate your own work.
Act only on tasks the main firstmate routes to you.
Never start a survey, audit, or "find improvements" sweep on your own initiative; that is not your job and it is unwanted.

# Requests from the main firstmate
You are a firstmate in your own home, so an incoming message reaches you in your own chat.
You must distinguish who it is from, because the answer goes to a different place.
A request relayed to you by the main firstmate is tagged with a leading \`$FM_FROMFIRST_LABEL\` marker followed by an invisible system separator; this marker is untypable, so a human never produces it.
When a message carries that marker, do the work, then respond via the STATUS/ESCALATION path below, never only in this chat: the main firstmate does not read your chat, so a chat-only reply is lost.
Marked requests also carry a privacy-safe \`corr=<id>\` token after the marker; include that exact token in your parent status reply (or in the status pointer to a detailed doc) so the parent can correlate the answer.
Optional helper: \`bin/fm-secondmate-report.sh\` can append a correlated status line for you, but a plain \`echo\` that includes the same \`corr=<id>\` is equally valid - do not depend on the helper being present.
For a terse result, a status line is the whole answer.
For a detailed answer (an investigation, a plan, an audit), write it to a doc under your home's \`data/\` and append a status line that points to that doc - the scout-report pattern - so the main firstmate is woken and can read it.
Before treating an investigation or visual review as complete, load \`decision-hold-lifecycle\` from this home's \`.agents/skills/\` and pass its shared completion gate.
A message with NO marker is the captain typing directly into your pane: treat it as authoritative captain intervention and stay conversational exactly as you would for any captain message; do not force it onto the status path.

# Escalation to main firstmate
Handle routine work yourself.
Report only true captain-relevant outcomes or a declared external wait by appending one line:
   \`echo "{state}: {one short line}" >> $STATUS_FILE\`
States: working, needs-decision, blocked, $PAUSED_VERB, done, failed.
Use \`$PAUSED_VERB: {why}\` (distinct from \`blocked:\`) only when your domain is deliberately idling on a known external wait you expect to clear on its own; use \`blocked:\` when you are stuck and need firstmate to act.
Use this only for material phase changes, a captain decision, a real blocker, a failure, or work ready for review.
This is also how you return the answer to a marked from-firstmate request above.
A marked request requires one correlated answer after the work; it does not require a separate receipt or start acknowledgement.
Never append \`working:\` merely to acknowledge receipt or announce that a marked request has started.
When a routed-work phase has a supervisor-actionable material change worth reporting under the rule above, give that reported phase a stable key.
If its first reportable event is \`working [key=<work-slug>]: {material phase}\`, use the same key on its later \`$PAUSED_VERB\`, \`done\`, \`failed\`, \`needs-decision\`, or \`blocked\` event so the earlier working phase is superseded.
When a keyed phase ends without another reportable state, append \`resolved [key=<work-slug>]: {why it is no longer active}\`.
When a decision you escalated is answered or a blocker clears and your domain resumes, append \`resolved: {how it was decided or unblocked}\` (keyed with \`[key=<slug>]\` if you opened it with one) so it is durably closed instead of resurfacing behind later unrelated events.
Routine internal supervision, heartbeats, retries, and crewmate churn stay inside your own home and must not touch that status file.

# Definition of done
You are persistent by default. Do not exit just because your queue is empty.
On startup and restart, run normal firstmate bootstrap and recovery through \`bin/fm-session-start.sh\` for your own home, but only to RECONCILE work that is already yours: in-flight crewmates, tracked backlog items, and durable watches recorded in this home.
When you have no assigned or in-flight work after that reconciliation, go idle and wait silently for the main firstmate to route you a task.
An empty queue is a healthy resting state, not a cue to invent work: never spawn a survey, audit, or any self-directed "find work" task on your own initiative.
If this charter cannot be carried out, append \`blocked: {why}\` or \`failed: {why}\` to the main status file and stop.

You are a crewmate: an autonomous worker agent managed by firstmate. Work on your own; do not wait for a human.

# Task
{TASK}

$HERDR_SECTION

# Setup
You are in a disposable git worktree of $REPO, at a detached HEAD on a clean default branch.
This is a SCOUT task: the deliverable is a written report, not a PR.
The worktree is your laboratory - install, run, edit, and make scratch commits freely; all of it is discarded at teardown.
The report is the only thing that survives, so anything worth keeping must be in it.

# Rules
1. Never push to any remote and never open a PR.
2. Never add a co-author trailer naming an AI model or assistant (e.g. \`Co-authored-by: Claude ...\`) to any commit.
   Human co-author trailers stay allowed.
3. Stay inside this worktree; the only files you may write outside it are the report and the status file below.
4. Use gh-axi for GitHub operations and chrome-devtools-axi for browser operations.
5. Report status by appending one line:
   \`echo "{state}: {one short line}" >> $STATUS_FILE\`
   States: working, needs-decision, blocked, $PAUSED_VERB, done, failed.
   Each append wakes firstmate, so report sparingly: only phase changes a supervisor
   would act on and the needs-decision/blocked/paused/done/failed states. No step-by-step
   FYI progress lines; firstmate reads your pane for that.
   Use \`$PAUSED_VERB: {why}\` - distinct from \`blocked:\` - ONLY when you are deliberately idling on a
   known external wait you expect to clear on its own (an upstream release, a rate-limit reset):
   firstmate then leaves your idle pane alone and rechecks it on a long cadence instead of
   treating it as a possible wedge. Use \`blocked:\` when you are stuck and need help.
6. If you hit the same obstacle twice, append \`blocked: {why}\` and stop; firstmate will help.
7. If a decision belongs to a human (product choices, destructive actions),
   append \`needs-decision: {summary of options}\` and stop. Firstmate will reply with the decision.
   When firstmate replies or a blocker clears and you resume, append \`resolved: {how it was decided or unblocked}\` (add the same \`[key=<slug>]\` if you opened it with one) so the decision or blocker is durably closed and does not keep resurfacing.
8. Never stop, restart, or update the shared \`no-mistakes\` daemon - it is one instance serving
   every lane/home, so restarting it kills other lanes' in-flight pipeline runs. On ANY no-mistakes
   daemon error, append \`blocked: {the daemon error}\` and stop; only firstmate manages the daemon.

# Definition of done
Write your findings to \`$DATA/$ID/report.md\`.
The report must stand alone: what you did, what you found, the evidence (commands run, output, file:line references), and what you recommend.
Before reporting done, read and follow \`$FM_ROOT/.agents/skills/decision-hold-lifecycle/SKILL.md\` and pass its shared completion gate for the report and any visual review.
When the report is complete, append \`done: {one-line conclusion}\` to the status file and stop.
If your findings reveal work that should ship (e.g. you reproduced a bug and the fix is clear), say so in the report; firstmate may promote this task in place, and you would then receive mode-specific ship instructions as a follow-up message.

You drive no-mistakes by responding to its gates, not by implementing fixes.
Follow the guidance no-mistakes itself provides for the mechanics: it loads when you invoke /no-mistakes, and `no-mistakes axi run --help` plus the `help` lines in each `axi` response are authoritative and version-matched to the installed binary.
Do not hand-edit, commit, abort, or restart while a run is active, and do not fix findings yourself - the pipeline applies every fix.

Two firstmate-specific rules layer on top of that guidance:
- ask-user findings are never yours to answer: escalate to firstmate (rule 7) and stop.
  Firstmate applies the authority contract in its `AGENTS.md` and obtains any required captain decision.
  When the decision comes back, feed it to the gate with `no-mistakes axi respond` and let the pipeline apply it - do not route the question to "the user" or implement the fix yourself.
- Avoid `--yes`: it would silently bypass firstmate's authority check and any required captain escalation, and the captain owns the ask-user decisions it would auto-resolve.

  FLOW_LEAD="# $DOD_ANCHOR
This project ships through a custom delivery workflow, and the contract in this section is this task's only definition of done.
Follow it exactly, and do not fall back to the default no-mistakes-to-PR pipeline unless this section tells you to.
This section WINS over every other instruction in this brief: where any delivery-mode, branch, push, PR, or completion instruction elsewhere here disagrees with this contract, this contract decides.
This contract is the project's single source of truth, injected here so it reaches you regardless of how this task was dispatched - do not go looking for it elsewhere."
  # Status-protocol bridge only: it wires the flow's own endpoint to rule 5's
  # reporting states without restating or reinterpreting any of the flow's steps.
  # It is a subsection of the heading above so the brief's only `done:` gate
  # lives under the section rule 5 points at through $DOD_ANCHOR.
  # A custom flow typically ends at a human gate (a captain preview, a stage
  # sign-off, a PR review). That is NOT the pause verb: rule 5 reserves that verb
  # for a wait that clears on its own, and firstmate answers it by leaving the
  # idle pane alone on a long recheck cadence, so a review-ready handoff reported
  # that way never reaches the captain. `needs-decision:` is the verb that means
  # a human must act, so the bridge names it for the handoff and keeps the pause
  # verb for a genuinely self-clearing wait such as a running deploy.
  # shellcheck disable=SC2016  # single quotes are deliberate: the backticks are literal brief-text markdown, and only the '"$PAUSED_VERB"' break-outs interpolate.
  FLOW_TAIL='## Reporting completion
Committing the change is not this task'"'"'s completion gate; the workflow above owns that gate.
Carry that workflow through to the point where it hands the work off, then report that point per rule 5.
Append `done: {summary}` when the workflow leaves nothing further for you to do.
Append `needs-decision: {what firstmate or the captain must decide}` when it hands off to a review, approval, or sign-off that will not clear on its own - a human has to act, so never report that handoff as `'"$PAUSED_VERB"':`.
Append `'"$PAUSED_VERB"': {why}` only for a bounded wait you expect to clear by itself and must come back to, such as a deploy run in progress.
Never report completion merely because the change is committed.'

# Setup - promotion from scout to ship
You investigated this task as a scout and keep this same worktree with its loaded context; it now holds scratch state from that investigation (experiments, debug edits, throwaway commits).
This task now ships a change through the delivery flow below, so first turn that scratch worktree into a clean ship base.

**Verify isolation before anything else.** Run \`pwd -P\` and \`git rev-parse --show-toplevel\`; both must resolve to the disposable task worktree you were launched in, not the primary checkout firstmate operates from.
If the top-level path is the primary checkout or not the worktree you were launched in, STOP - do not branch or commit here - append \`blocked: launched in primary checkout, not an isolated worktree\` to the status file and stop.

1. Inventory your scratch state: run \`git status\` and \`git log --oneline\` so you know exactly what you changed while scouting.
2. Return to a clean base off the current default branch, carrying over ONLY the intended fix changes. Scratch commits, debug edits, and throwaway experiments must NOT ride along, and a bug you reproduced while scouting becomes the regression test for this fix.
3. Once the base is clean, create your ship branch: \`git checkout -b fm/$ID\`.$SETUP2_PROMOTE

The path check is authoritative: \`git rev-parse --git-dir\` and \`git rev-parse --git-common-dir\` can help inspect the repo, but they do not prove you are outside the primary checkout.

# Rules
$RULE1
2. Never add a co-author trailer naming an AI model or assistant (e.g. \`Co-authored-by: Claude ...\`) to any commit.
   Human co-author trailers stay allowed.
3. Stay inside this worktree; modify nothing outside it.
4. Use gh-axi for GitHub operations and chrome-devtools-axi for browser operations.
5. Report status by appending one line:
   \`echo "{state}: {one short line}" >> $STATUS_FILE\`
   States: working, needs-decision, blocked, $PAUSED_VERB, done, failed.
   Each append wakes firstmate, so report sparingly: only phase changes a supervisor
   would act on (setup done, bug reproduced, fix implemented, validation passed) and the
   needs-decision/blocked/paused/done/failed states. No step-by-step FYI progress lines;
   firstmate reads your pane for that.
   A mid-task \`working:\` line (including setup complete) is nonterminal: do not end the
   turn after it; continue the same stage until a defined \`done:\` gate under $DOD_ANCHOR.
   Use \`$PAUSED_VERB: {why}\` - distinct from \`blocked:\` - ONLY when you are deliberately idling on a
   known external wait you expect to clear on its own (an upstream release, a rate-limit reset,
   a scheduled window): firstmate then leaves your idle pane alone and rechecks it on a long
   cadence instead of treating it as a possible wedge. Use \`blocked:\` when you are stuck and need help.
6. If you hit the same obstacle twice, append \`blocked: {why}\` and stop; firstmate will help.
7. If a decision belongs above the implementation worker (product choices, destructive actions, ask-user findings),
   append \`needs-decision: {summary of options}\` and stop. Firstmate will apply the configured authority and reply with the decision.
   When firstmate replies or a blocker clears and you resume, append \`resolved: {how it was decided or unblocked}\` (add the same \`[key=<slug>]\` if you opened it with one) so the decision or blocker is durably closed and does not keep resurfacing.
8. Never stop, restart, or update the shared \`no-mistakes\` daemon - it is one instance serving
   every lane/home, so restarting it kills other lanes' in-flight pipeline runs. On ANY no-mistakes
   daemon error, append \`blocked: {the daemon error}\` and stop; only firstmate manages the daemon.

# Project memory
If \`AGENTS.md\` or \`CLAUDE.md\` already exists, or if this task produced durable project-intrinsic knowledge, run \`$FM_ROOT/bin/fm-ensure-agents-md.sh .\` in the worktree.
Record only project knowledge useful to almost every future session.
For anything the codebase already shows, prefer a pointer to the authoritative file, command, or doc over copying the detail.
If you touch a project \`AGENTS.md\` that lacks \`## Maintaining this file\`, add that short self-governance section from \`$FM_ROOT/bin/fm-ensure-agents-md.sh\` in the same pass.
Keep it proportionate: skip \`AGENTS.md\` edits for trivial tasks that produced no durable project knowledge.
